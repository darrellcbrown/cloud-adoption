# The Cloud Adoption Framework
> Transformation is more than technology adoption; it's also about people, processes and culture.
##  Friction
Some of the areas of friction that will need to be addressed before any hope of a successful outcome can be expected.
1. STRATEGY: Organizations moving to the cloud must make migration and modernization decisions to determine the best fit for existing applications and data.
2. TALENT: Organizations require the right talent to fuel innovation and usually require organizational-culture changes to support new ways of working to achieve the intended velocity of change.
3. TOOLS: Organizations can encounter risks as tool selections made for traditional enterprises may not be the right ones for development for the cloud.
4. DEVELOPMENT: This can come from internal and external sources. Make sure you select the right tool for your organization.
5. OPERATIONS: Internal teams may have to rethink on the boundaries of control as capabilities and concerns may overlap
