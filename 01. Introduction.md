# Introduction
## What is the driver of this book?
Many companies are sold on the cloud but lack a solid roadmap for disrupting their own business to leverage to its value to their advantage. The book is written primarily to C-level suites and those teams that fall below its hieararchy.

## Punching above your weight
Glenn Scoby (Pop) Warner was a football coach that enabled his team to compete against much larger teams. Because of his coaching acumen, he enabled his teams to “punch above their weight.” Cloud technologies and digital technologies hold the same promise. They enable smaller companies to become faster, more nimble and as a result just as, if not more than, competitive than companies multiple times their size.

## What this book delivers
The Cloud Adoption Playbook will provide a conceptual framework for cloud adoption and digital transformation, along with a complete, structured, holistic and pragmatic approach for succeeding in the cloud.
