# Business Drivers

> The last best experience that people have anywhere becomes the minimum expectation for the experience that they want everywhere, including the enterprise.

This competitive landscape demands that enterprises must command their own digital transformation, rethinking what customers value and create operating models that create opportunities for competitive differentiation.

The challenge for enterprises is how fast and how far to go down the path to digital transformation and cloud adoption.

## Addressing the challenges
The core of digital transformation is about meeting the changing expectations of the customer-base using digital technology. This is where the cloud comes into the equation; cloud enables the implementation of technology at scale to wow your customers.

## What drives a business to the cloud?
Because technology (ala cloud) are just means to an end, it is important to define your enterprise’s meaningful “end” in terms of a business or mission strategic intent.
* Accelerate time to market
* Higher customer service
* Increased market share
* Repeatability and flexibility
* Operational excellence (this is literally Globe’s business strategic pillars)
* Improved data access
* Increase pace of innovation

Meeting the business drivers requires change and organizational transformation that goes beyond technology adoption. Digital transformation and cloud adoption must be placed within the context of  your business for a truly holistic approach. You should take into account of what it takes to show progress in the short term and what the long term will look like.

### Answer the question, “what does success look like?”
1. What are the specific measures of success?
2. What are some quick wins in the short term that the cloud could help to achieve?
3. What does sustainable success look like in the long term for the digital transformation journey,

Cloud offers enormous potential; those who adopt increase their chances of becoming distruptors and leaders in their respective markets.

Innovator’s dilemma; striking the balance to create new things and maintain the old things.

## What do you gain from the cloud?
Cloud adoption and the overall digital transformation program needs to be defined and aligned to the business objectives of the organization. It may be expressed in a few simple phrases such as:
- Creating a customer-focused enterprise.
- Increasing flexibility and streamlining operations.
- Driving innovation while minimizing cost.
- Optimizing enterprise risk management.

## What are the implications to the enterprise?
This is usually realized in the form of contracts with outsourced professional services.
